  are now under the nullary CC0 1.0 Universal terms:

  To the extent possible under law, 唐鳳 has waived all copyright and
  related or neighboring rights to Module-Signature.

[Changes for 0.24 - 2005-08-17]

* Explicity use "Encode::EBCDIC" and "Encode::IBM" at Parse::AFP
  loading time, to reduce runtime loading penalty and make it easier
  for PAR to detect the dependency.  Reported by Sunny Chou.

[Changes for 0.23 - 2004-10-21]

* udcsplit.pl now always allocates constant memory.

[Changes for 0.21 - 2004-10-14]

* udc4pca.pl now supports RMI/RMB sections.
* In cp835, \x40\x40 is recognised as a character.
* Both afpmkfontdb.pl and udc4pca.pl now supports multiple font databases.
* "Missing font in database" is no longer a fatal exception for udc4pca. 
* If a file has no UDC chunks, don't bother joining individual pages, just
  copy the whole file.

[Changes for 0.20 - 2004-10-13]

* Apply the same logic fix to udc4pca.pl.
* In udcsplit.pl, do not bother to parse PTX once a UDC is found.

* Sort afp fragments before join them.

[Changes for 0.19 - 2004-10-13]

* The UDC lookahead logic was broken in udcsplit.pl; its offset needs
  to be 11 bytes, not 2 bytes.

[Changes for 0.18 - 2004-10-13]

* udc4pca.pl was not writing IM sections.

  by Thomas Yeh.

[Changes for 0.17 - 2004-10-12]

* More udc4pca.pl optimization: only processes PTX chunks that has
  UDC in its TRN sequences; everything else is sent directly to output.

[Changes for 0.16 - 2004-10-12]

* Make the tight loop even faster using a dedicated tight_loop() contruct.
  Requires setting {output_file} in new(), like script/udc4pca.pl now does.

[Changes for 0.15 - 2004-10-12]

* On lazy evaluation with callback_members that includes '*', skip all
  noninteresting callbacks and simply write them into the output file.

* udc4pca: use Black as the UDC color instead of 0200.

[Changes for 0.11 - 2004-09-22]

* In udc4pca.pl, respect SBI and BLN in setting baseline increments.

  Contributed by Thomas Yeh.

[Changes for 0.09 - 2004-09-16]

* Fixed an infinite loop bug when parsing MCF1.
* afpdump.pl can now decode character sets using -e.
* We now depend on Encode::IBM to process various IBM-specific encodings.
* New utility, udc4pca.pl, that fills in UDC characters from fonts.db. 
* New API, ->spawn_obj, that constructs a new AFP record object.

[Changes for 0.08 - 2004-09-13]

* The HTML generated by afpdump.pl is now much more readable and pretty.
* Added the ability of detecting and displaying info on fixed width fonts
  to afpmkfontdb.pl and afpviewfontdb.pl.
* More correct parsing for PGD and STO.
* Fixed a spurious warning in afpconv.pl.
